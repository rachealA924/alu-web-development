# HTML Advanced - Web Page Structure from Figma

Welcome to the **HTML Advanced** project! In this challenge, you'll be building a fully structured HTML page using semantic HTML5 elements — **no CSS**, **no JavaScript**, just **clean, well-organized HTML** based on a professional Figma design file.

## 📁 Project Structure

This project lives in the repository: `alu-web-development`  
Project directory: `html_advanced`

Your job is to replicate the structure of the web page exactly as shown in the design, paying close attention to:

- Semantic HTML tags
- Proper nesting and structure
- Accessibility-friendly markup
- Readability and maintainability
