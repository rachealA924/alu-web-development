# 🎨 Advanced CSS Project

This project builds upon the HTML structure created in the previous `html_advanced` task. The goal is to apply full CSS styling to match a high-fidelity design provided in Figma.

## 📄 Project Overview

We used **semantic HTML5** and are now applying **responsive and clean CSS styling** to bring the static structure to life.

### ✅ What’s Included
- Fully structured `index.html` copied from the previous project
- Custom styles written in `styles.css`
- Layout, typography, spacing, and component styling based on the Figma design
